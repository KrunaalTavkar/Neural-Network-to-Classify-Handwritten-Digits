# Neural-Network-to-Classify-Handwritten-Digits
A Neural Network implementation, designed from scratch, to classify the MNIST Database of Handwritten Numbers

# Description
This is an implementation of a Neural Network Deep Learning Model, (designed from the groud up, without using existing libraries) to identify and classify Handwritten digits from the MNIST Dataset.

This particular implementation is based on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP, just another term for fully connected feedforward networks), which is shown as following. It is designed for a K-class classification problem.

# MLP Definitions
Let  (x∈ℝD,y∈{1,2,⋯,K})  be a labeled instance, such an MLP performs the following computations:
